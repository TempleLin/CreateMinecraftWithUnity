Perlin Noise with Fractional Brownian Motion algorithm is added to MeshUtils for generating chunks with heights. These algorithms are also used in ChunkBuilder for generating heights for the chunk.

World location of a chunk is also added as one of the ChunkBuilder's attributes ("location"), in order to generate chunks continuously in world terrain. It's also used as attributes to calculate its height through the Perlin Noise algorithm.

Since the chunk now has world space location, the BlockBuilder it used also needs to be modified. First, the BlockBuilder's offset member has combined the world location of chunk in its total value.
 Second, its algorithm for calculating block neighbours still needs to remain using local offset of the block in the chunk. Therefore, its "offset" value used for calculation ignores chunk's world location.
